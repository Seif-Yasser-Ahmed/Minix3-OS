First requirement is to modify minix scheduling algorithms to the following:

1.Round Robin

2.Shortest Job First (SJF)

3.Priority based

4.Multi-Level Feedback Queue

Second requirement is to implement hirarchical paging in Minix:

with all the needed parameters (page size, number
of levels, address format â€¦ etc.).
Additionally, FIFO and LRU page replacement are implemented.

Third requirement is to modify disk-space management code in Minix 

To use user-defined extents. Also, the disk allocation is modified to provide the allocation in terms of
